This repository details several projects that I had worked on during my enrollment in Computer Systems Principles at University of Massachusetts Amherst. The class was taught by Joe Chieu, and Tim Richards, and involved learning about rudimentary Computer Systems concepts, such as caching, VRAM structure, networking, as well as value representation through bits in machines. The class allowed students to be able to use C to implement features such as bit shifting, caching bits, connecting to servers and receiving/sending pockets of encrypted/decrypted data.
The class allowed me to learn a lot about the inner workings of Computer Systems, as well as gain an advanced understanding about C concepts as well, such as pointer, memory handling, memory address and call-by-value.
